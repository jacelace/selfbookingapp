2. **Rescheduling System**:
   - Design rescheduling interface
   - Implement date/time selection for rescheduling
   - Add validation for new time slots
   - Create Firebase functions for booking updates

3. **Email Notification System**:
   - Set up email service provider
   - Create email templates
   - Implement trigger points for notifications
   - Add email preference management

4. **Testing and Review**:
   - Test all new functionality
   - Review user experience
   - Validate Firebase rules
   - Check email delivery and formatting

## Technical Considerations

- Ensure proper error handling for all new features

- Implement proper validation for all user actions

## Documentation Updates Needed

After implementing these features:
